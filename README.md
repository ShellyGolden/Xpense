# Xpense

The **Xpense** project is an open source platform for financial housekeeping.
Its main objective is to monitor financial housekeeping related income and expenses.
In addition, it provides the option to share data anonymously, thereby
providing others the opportunity to compare and learn from families in the same status group.

## Addressing the Challenge

Families and households are going into financial distress and
the stigma of talking about the finance in the house is
considered taboo.

**Xpense** provides the option to monitor and share data
anonymously, thereby providing others the opportunity to compare
and learn from people facing the same financial challenges.

We think that by monitoring and learning from examples of other people,
the financial household management crisis of our time could be helped.
